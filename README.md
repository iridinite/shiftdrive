ShiftDrive is a networked multiplayer where up to six people control a spaceship together. Communication and coordination is key - is your team solid enough to survive the harsh environments of outer space?

The game is built with the MonoGame Framework ([http://www.monogame.net/](http://www.monogame.net/)). In order to compile it, you'll need to install MonoGame. You'll also need C# 6.0 or higher (5.0 might work but I'm not sure), which means using Visual Studio 2015.
