ShiftDrive is a networked multiplayer game where up to six people control a spaceship together. Communication and coordination is key - is your team solid enough to survive the harsh environments of outer space?

This project is far from completion, but I'm using GitHub both as an experiment - this is my first dive into open-source software - and as a backup system. While right now there's not a lot to look at, if and when the project matures, I'm open for issue reports and/or pull requests!

The game is built with the MonoGame Framework ([http://www.monogame.net/](http://www.monogame.net/)). To compile, you'll need to install MonoGame. C# 6.0 is also required, so that means using Visual Studio 2015.
