ShiftDrive is a networked multiplayer game where up to six people control a spaceship together. Communication and coordination is key - is your team solid enough to survive the harsh environments of outer space?

The game is built with the MonoGame Framework 3.6 ([http://www.monogame.net/](http://www.monogame.net/)). The core framework is included through NuGet packages, however you still need to manually install the build tools in order to compile the game.
