ShiftDrive is a networked multiplayer where up to six people control a spaceship together. Communication and coordination is key - is your team solid enough to survive the harsh environments of outer space?

The game is built with the MonoGame Framework ([http://www.monogame.net/](http://www.monogame.net/)). To compile, you'll need to install MonoGame. C# 6.0 is also required, so that means using Visual Studio 2015.
